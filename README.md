# 📊 Financial Data Analysis and Modeling

This project explores key concepts in financial data science through practical applications involving data quality assessment, yield curve modeling, and dimensionality reduction techniques. The goal is to apply robust quantitative methods to real-world financial datasets and derive actionable insights.

## 🔍 Project Components

### 1. Data Quality Assessment
- Identifies examples of poor-quality structured and unstructured data.
- Evaluates violations of good data governance principles.

### 2. Yield Curve Modeling
- Fits both **Nelson-Siegel** and **Cubic Spline** models to government bond yield data across a range of maturities.
- Compares models based on fit, parameter interpretation, and discusses the ethics of curve smoothing.

### 3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on Yield Changes
- Performs PCA on both simulated and real government bond yield changes.
- Includes scree plots and variance decomposition to highlight dominant components.

### 4. Empirical ETF Analysis
- Analyzes a sector ETF by evaluating its top holdings.
- Computes returns, applies PCA and **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** to uncover latent structure in asset relationships.
